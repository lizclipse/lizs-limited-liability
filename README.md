# Liz's Limited Liability

A modpack with the intent to extend and enhance instead of overhaul.

Note for Steam Deck: You may need to manually disable `Vivecraft`.
Since this modpack is mostly for me and my own, I've added that mod so I can
play in VR with others being able to see me, but, from testing, I've found that
it can crashes the game on Steam Deck for some reason.
I'll open an issue at some point if it reoccurs, but for now this is the only caveat.

## Goals

- Lightweight
  - Number of mods is less important than size
- Steam Deck compatability & controller support
  - I want to play this on the sofa and with a controller sue me

## Mod Overview

This is a non-exhaustive list of mods included in this modpack.
It is split into categories based on how it affects the game and by how much.
Not included are things like performance mods, fixes, and libraries.

### Notes

Some dependency overrides are included because there's some weirdness with mismatched casing
and incomplete metadata.
Each one is tested to make sure it's just a surface-level issue.

## Server

Compose definition:

```yml
version: "3.8"

services:
  mc:
    image: docker.io/itzg/minecraft-server
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    ports:
      # Server
      - "25565:25565"
      # Voice chat
      - "24454:24454"
    environment:
      - "EULA=true"
      - "TYPE=quilt"
      - "PACKWIZ_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lizclipse/lizs-limited-liability/v0.4.0/pack.toml"
      - "VERSION=1.20.1"
      - "MAX_MEMORY=5G"
      - "ENABLE_AUTOPAUSE=true"
      - "AUTOPAUSE_KNOCK_INTERFACE=tap0"
      - "MAX_TICK_TIME=-1"
    volumes:
      # attach the relative directory 'data' to the container's /data path
      - "./volumes/mc/l3:/data:Z"
    restart: always
    cap_add:
      - CAP_NET_RAW
    network_mode: "slirp4netns:port_handler=slirp4netns"
```

### Dynmap support (currently broken)

For Dynmap to work, the compose will need a couple of additions:

```yml
ports:
  - "8123:8123"
environment:
  # Needed to fix an incompatability with dynmap & quilt
  - "JVM_DD_OPTS=loader.workaround.jar_copy_all_mods=true"
```
